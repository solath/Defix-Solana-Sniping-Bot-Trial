## ❓ FAQ

<details>
  <summary>How does the bot detect liquidity injection in SPL tokens?</summary>
  <p>The Defix Solana Sniping Bot uses a technique called 'listening' to detect liquidity injection in SPL tokens. It continuously monitors the Solana blockchain for new token listings or liquidity additions to existing listings. Once a new liquidity injection is detected, the bot triggers a purchase transaction to buy the token at the current market price. This enables users to gain swift access to emerging token opportunities.</p>

  <summary>Can I monitor multiple tokens simultaneously with the bot?</summary>
  <p>The free trial version of the Defix Solana Sniping Bot only allows you to monitor and snipe one token at a time. If you would like to monitor and snipe multiple tokens simultaneously, you may consider upgrading to the premium version of the bot. The premium version offers more advanced features and capabilities, including the ability to monitor and snipe multiple tokens at the same time.</p>
