## FAQ

<details>
  <summary>How does the bot detect liquidity injection in SPL tokens?</summary>
  <p>The Defix Solana Sniping Bot uses a technique called "listening" to detect liquidity injection in SPL tokens. It continuously monitors the Solana blockchain for new token listings or liquidity additions to existing listings. Once a new liquidity injection is detected, the bot triggers a purchase transaction to buy the token at the current market price. This enables users to gain swift access to emerging token opportunities.

Please note that this bot is a free trial version and may not have the same level of performance and features as the premium version. For more information on the premium version, you can join the Defix Telegram channel at https://t.me/defixann..</p>
