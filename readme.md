## FAQ

<details>
  <summary>How does the bot detect liquidity injection in SPL tokens?</summary>
  <p>The Defix Solana Sniping Bot uses a technique called 'listening' to detect liquidity injection in SPL tokens. It continuously monitors the Solana blockchain for new token listings or liquidity additions to existing listings. Once a new liquidity injection is detected, the bot triggers a purchase transaction to buy the token at the current market price. This enables users to gain swift access to emerging token opportunities.</p>

  <p>The free trial version of the Defix Solana Sniping Bot only allows you to monitor and snipe one token at a time.
